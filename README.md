# RetroBoard

RetroBoard is a React-based web app I've built for creating and managing retrospective boards. It provides a collaborative space for team restrospectives allowing users to add, edit, and move cards across the three categories: Went Well, To Improve, and Action Items.

## Features

- **Move Cards:** Cards can be moved between categories using drag and drop or with the move buttons based on layout direction.
- **Card Management:** Add, edit, delete, like, and dislike cards.
- **Dynamic Text Area:** Height of the text area is automatically adjusted based on the content.
- **Responsive:** Switch between row and column layouts for the board using the button or automatically based on size of screen.

## Installation

To use RetroBoard, you will need to make sure you have node.js and npm installed. Then you will clone the RetroBoard repository, install the dependencies, and start the development server.
