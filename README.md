# RetroBoard

RetroBoard is a React-based web app I've built for creating and managing retrospective boards. It provides a collaborative space for team restrospectives allowing users to add, edit, and move cards across the three categories: Went Well, To Improve, and Action Items.

## Features

- **Move Cards:** Cards can be moved between categories using drag and drop or with the move buttons based on layout direction.
- **Responsive Layout:** Switch between row and column layouts for the board using the button or based on size of screen.
- **Card Management:** Add, edit, delete, like, and dislike cards.
- **Dynamic Text Area:** Height of the text area is automatically adjusted based on the content.
